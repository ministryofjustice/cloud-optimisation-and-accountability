# Cloud Optimisation and Accountability

## Our mission

To optimise cloud costs and environmental impact, and maximise value of cloud to Ministry of Justice (MoJ) through collaboration, transparency and continuous improvement.

## How are we going to help MoJ do that?

We are an enablement team, helping all other teams, improve the value we get from our cloud infrastructure, through a data driven approach for optimising cost, environmental impact, and usage. This is based around the cultural practices of [FinOps](https://www.finops.org/introduction/what-is-finops/) and [GreenOps](https://learn.greensoftware.foundation/). 

We are putting data in the path of all those who make decisions around how we build and operate software within the Cloud, as well as helping to set standards and best practices.

We have published our [2025/26 Strategy](https://justiceuk.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/CloudOptimisationAccoutabilityTeam/Shared%20Documents/General/Strategy/FinOps_GreenOps%20Strategy%202025_26%20v1.docx?d=w5f167eb28d8646e9a944b0b5131054b3&csf=1&web=1&e=qLPGWO) for more details.
