# Mission Statement

To optimise cloud expenditure, reduce environmental impact, and maximise the value of cloud computing to the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) through collaboration, transparency and continuous improvement.

## How are we going to help MoJ do that?

We are an enablement team, helping all other teams to improve the value we get from our cloud infrastructure, through a data driven approach to optimise cost and usage, and reduce environmental impact. These strategies are based on the cultural practices of [FinOps](https://www.finops.org/introduction/what-is-finops/) and [GreenOps](https://learn.greensoftware.foundation/). 

We are putting data in the path of all those who make decisions around how we build and operate software within the Cloud, as well as helping to set standards and best practices.

Please see our published our [2025/26 Strategy](https://justiceuk.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/CloudOptimisationAccoutabilityTeam/Shared%20Documents/General/Strategy/FinOps_GreenOps%20Strategy%202025_26%20v1.docx?d=w5f167eb28d8646e9a944b0b5131054b3&csf=1&web=1&e=qLPGWO) for more details.
