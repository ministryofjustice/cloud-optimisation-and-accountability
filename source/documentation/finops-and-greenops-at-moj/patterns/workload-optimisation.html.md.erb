# What is Workload Optimisation?

**Workload optimization** is the process of continuously improving the performance, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness of cloud resources. It involves aligning resource usage with actual demand, right-sizing infrastructure, and leveraging scalable services such as autoscaling, containers, or serverless architectures. 

In a FinOps context, workload optimization is essential because it directly impacts cloud spendâ€”helping organizations eliminate waste, maximize return on investment, and ensure that teams are using cloud resources responsibly. By optimizing workloads, businesses can strike the right balance between cost, performance, and reliability.

In addition to improving cost efficiency, the reduction in usage or adoption of more efficient resources can also significantly improve the sustainability of your service.

## Examples of workload optimisations

- Right-Sizing Compute Resources
- Instance Scheduling/Shut down evenings and weekends
- Autoscaling
- Serverless architectures
- Lifecycle policies
- Removing unused resources
