# Migrate to Graviton-based instance types

## Summary

[AWS Graviton processors](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/graviton/) are AWS-designed Arm-based CPUs that deliver price-performance and energy efficiency for a broad range of cloud workloads. By migrating compatible workloads to Graviton-based instances and leveraging Graviton in managed services (e.g. RDS, OpenSearch, ElastiCache), teams can reduce costs and improve sustainability through lower emissions without degrading performance.

## Implementation complexity

**Medium**

Graviton optimisation usually involves:

- Selecting appropriate Graviton instance families (e.g. T-series, M/C/R-series)
- Rebuilding or validating application binaries for Arm64 where necessary
- Testing performance and compatibility

Workloads written in platform-independent languages (e.g. Java, Python, Node.js, Go) typically require minimal code changes beyond recompilation.

## When to use Graviton?

Consider migrating to Graviton when:

- Running general-purpose, compute or memory-intensive workloads that are consistently consuming CPU resources
- You need to reduce infrastructure cost while sustaining or improving performance
- Your applications can run on Arm64 or your build pipelines support multi-architecture images
- Sustainability targets (carbon reduction, energy efficiency) are part of engineering goals

## Key benefits

**Cost Optimisation**

- Up to **~20–40%** better price-performance compared to equivalent x86 instances, meaning either lower hourly cost for the same work or more throughput per dollar spent
- Improved performance often lets teams rightsizing instances downward, further reducing spend
- Combining Graviton migration with Savings Plans or Reserved Instances amplifies cost reduction over time

**Sustainability / Energy Efficiency**

- Graviton processors consume significantly less energy (~up to 60% less) than comparable x86 instances for the same performance, reducing data centre power draw and associated carbon emissions
- Lower power usage also reduces heat output, which in turn lowers cooling requirements in AWS infrastructure

## Risks

Some legacy software, proprietary binaries, or OS dependencies may not support Arm64, requiring code changes or testing.

In rare cases, performance characteristics differ; always conduct performance validation.

Migration planning should consider CI/CD pipeline updates and dependency management for multi-architecture.

## Practical steps

**Inventory & Eligibility Assessment**

- Identify compute resources (EC2, RDS, OpenSearch, ElastiCache, Lambda) that could benefit from Graviton
- Flag workloads that currently run on x86 and assess compatibility with Arm64

**Proof-of-Concept**

- Rebuild application binaries or create multi-arch container images
- Test performance and reliability on Graviton instance types in non-production environments

**Benchmark & Validate Costs**

- Compare benchmark results (throughput, latency) to x86 baseline
- Analyse pricing differences and forecast net savings

**Migrate & Monitor**

- Incrementally migrate workloads to Graviton
- Use tools (e.g. Graviton Savings Dashboard, [COAT Cost & Usage Dashboard](https://cloud-optimisation-and-accountability.justice.gov.uk/documentation/finops-and-greenops-at-moj/tools/dashboard.html)) to monitor realised and potential savings

**Rightsize & Optimise**

- Adjust instance sizes based on actual performance and utilisation.
- Review the architecture for additional efficiencies (auto-scaling, spot instances, Savings Plans).
