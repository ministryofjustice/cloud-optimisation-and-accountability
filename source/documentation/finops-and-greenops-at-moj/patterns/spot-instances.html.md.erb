# Spot Instances

## What Are Spot Instances?

[Spot Instances](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/spot/) let you use AWS's unused EC2 capacity at up to 90% discount compared to On-Demand prices. However, they can be interrupted with only 2 minutes' notice when AWS needs the capacity back.

## When to use Spot Instances

Spot Instances are best for **fault-tolerant, stateless, or parallelizable workloads**.

- Batch Processing / Data Analysis - jobs can be checkpointed or restarted without data loss e.g. image rendering, video encoding, big data ETL, log processing

- CI/CD workloads - build/test jobs can be restarted easily if interrupted e.g. code builds, test environments, packaging

- Machine Learning (ML) Training - ML training jobs can often resume from checkpoints or be parallelized

- Stateless Web Services in Auto Scaling Groups - You can mix Spot with On-Demand or Reserved Instances to save costs while maintaining availability e.g. backend services or APIs with horizontal scaling.

## When not to use Spot Instances

Avoid Spot Instances when you need:

- guaranteed availability - e.g. customer-facing applications, databases, or critical services

- stateful applications - applications that rely heavily on persistent storage or specific instance states may not be suitable, unless you have robust mechanisms for handling interruptions

- low-latency requirements - i.e. spot interruptions might introduce unacceptable latency or recovery time

## Best Practices
