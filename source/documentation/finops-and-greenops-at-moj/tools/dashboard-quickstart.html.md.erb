# AWS Cost & Usage Dashboard Quick Start Guide

## Introduction

This Dashboard has been created to help Teams understand the cost, usage, and environmental impact associated to their AWS resources.

The purpose of this quick start guide is to help Teams familiarise themselves with how the Dashboard works and the types of data available.

## Controls

These controls allow you to filter the data in the Dashboard via a number of mandatory tags and important data types. You can use as many filters as required to identify your data.

Control definitions:

- **Business Unit** - Should be one of `HMPPS`, `OPG`, `LAA`, `Central Digital`, `Technology Services`, `HMCTS`, `CICA`, or `OCTO`. 

- **Service Area** - Service Area that usage is related to e.g. `Hosting`

- **Application** - Application that usage is related to e.g. `CCMS`

- **Account** - AWS Account Name e.g. `Cloud Platform`

- **Namespace** - Cloud Platform Namespace (Environment) name e.g. `laa-amend-a-claim-dev`

- **Billing Period** - The time window AWS uses to calculate usage

- **Owner** - This is the team responsible for the overall service

- **Environment** - Identifies whether usage relates to `Production`, `Non-Production`, or `No is-production tag` i.e. missing tags

> Note: Many of these values are free text and case sensitive so you may find many combinations of similar tags depending on how they have been entered e.g. `NOMIS` and `nomis`. Recommended you correct tags for consistency.

If you wish to reset a control to remove it or change it use the **"Show selected"** radio button to show values that can be removed.

If you expect to see a particular value in the list of values but it is not there please check your AWS resource tags in the first instance. Otherwise, [contact COAT](https://cloud-optimisation-and-accountability.justice.gov.uk/#contacts)

For more information on mandatory resource tags please refer to the [Tagging Standard](https://cloud-optimisation-and-accountability.justice.gov.uk/documentation/finops-and-greenops-at-moj/standards/tagging.html)

## Tagging Coverage for Business Unit

This section shows compliance with the [MoJ Tagging Standard](https://cloud-optimisation-and-accountability.justice.gov.uk/documentation/finops-and-greenops-at-moj/standards/tagging.html#tagging-standard). You can use this to improve your taggaing and usage allocation i.e. to make sure you have a full picture of your costs

## Cost by Category

This section helps you understand your cost in different ways:

- **Cost in USD** - Total cost

- **Cost per Region** - Cost split by AWS Region

- **Cost over Time** - Timeseries for cost over the seleceted billing period

- **Cost per environment** - Cost split by user defined enviornment

- **Cost per Business Area** - Cost split by Business Unit

## Kubernetes (EKS) Cost

This section only relates to services that are running on a Kubernetes cluster e.g. Cloud Platform.

For users running on these types of platform it is difficult to understand compute cost, as containers are running on large shared EC2 Instances. This view allows you to see **Used** and **Unused** cost. The **Used** cost tells you how much your compute resources actually cost. **Unused** indicates over provisioning and opportunities for right-sizing. 

## Top 10s

This section shows curated views of the top 10 of cost and usage sorted a number of different ways to help identify opportunities for optimisation. This includes **Application**, **AWS Services** (e.g. RDS, S3, EC2), **Namespaces** (relates to Cloud Platform hosted apps only) and **AWS Account**.

## Total Emissions Change - Last 2 complete months

This panel will only show the percentage difference in emission for the last two complete months of usage. Changing the `Billing Period` in the controls may result in a `No Data` message if the data range doesn't include data from the previous two months.

## Miles Driven in Average Family Car Last Full Month

Equivalent total emissions in miles driven in an average family car for the previous month. Changing the `Billing Period` in the controls may result in a `No Data` message if the data range doesn't include data from the previous month.

## Note on Emissions

All Emissions data is expressed in `tCO2e`. This is **tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent**, a standard unit used to measure and compare the climate impact of different greenhouse gases (GHGs) by converting them to the amount of carbon dioxide that would cause the same warming effect. It's crucial in carbon accounting for calculating total greenhouse gas footprints, as gases like methane and nitrous oxide have much higher global warming potentials (GWPs).

## Usage Emissions

Usage Emissions (or Operational Carbon) are greenhouse gases generated from the electricity consumed to power and cool servers, networking equipment, and storage devices during day-to-day operations.

## Embedded Emissions

Embedded Emissions (or Embodied Carbon) is the carbon emitted during the manufacturing, transportation, installation, and disposal of physical hardware devices.
