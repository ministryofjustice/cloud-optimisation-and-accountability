# AWS Billing and Cost Management

Two of the key tools that we use for cost and usage analysis are:

- [Cost Explorer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cost-management/latest/userguide/ce-what-is.html) - allows you to visualize, analyze, and track your AWS usage and spending over time. It provides interactive charts and filtering options to break down costs by service, account, tag, or linked resource, helping teams identify trends, forecast future expenses, and pinpoint areas of overspending. You can view 3 years of historical data and cost forecasting for up to 12 months ahead.

- [Cost Optimisation Hub](https://aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/cost-optimization-hub/) - a centralized dashboard that helps you identify and act on cost-saving opportunities across your AWS environments. It consolidates recommendations from multiple AWS servicesâ€”such as Compute Optimizer, Trusted Advisor, and Savings Plans and organizes them by impact and feasibility. This enables teams to quickly prioritize the most effective actions for reducing spend, such as rightsizing underutilised instances, removing unused resources, and upgrading to more efficient rescource types. The hub is designed to simplify cost optimization by providing a unified, actionable view tailored to your specific usage patterns.

While COAT have access to **all** the data for MoJ and have a complete overview of the whole estate via the Root Account, you can view all your own cost and optimisation recommendations in your member account.
