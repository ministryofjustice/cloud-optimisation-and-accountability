# AWS Cost & Usage Dashboard (Beta)

## Background

Making cost, usage, and carbon data readily accessible is essential to enabling informed, timely decision-making across the organisation. By bringing together cloud spend, resource utilisation, and emissions insights in a single dashboard, teams gain a clearer understanding of the financial and environmental impact of their technology choices.

This shared visibility supports more accountable budgeting, drives both cost and carbon optimisation, and helps align cloud investment with business and sustainability goals. When FinOps and GreenOps data are available side by side, conversations move beyond reactive cost control to strategic optimisation — turning insights into actions that reduce spend, lower emissions, and deliver measurable business value.

To support this we have created a dashboard to make data available.

This dashboard is in **beta phase** of development.

## How to access the dashboard
