# Cost & Usage Dashboard (Beta)

## Background

Making cost and usage data readily available is key to empowering informed, timely decision-making across the organisation. By providing visibility into cloud spend, usage patterns, and allocation, teams can better understand the financial impact of their technology choices. This transparency supports more accountable budgeting, encourages cost optimisation, and helps align cloud investment with business value. When FinOps data is accessible, it shifts cost conversations from reactive to strategic â€” turning insights into actions.

To support this we have created a dashboard to make data available.

While our dashboard has no current documenation we have provided a video tutorial that explains the content of the dashboard and how to use it. This is available via the Dashboard.

This dashboard is in **beta phase** of development.

## How to access the dashboard

Access the dashboard via this link - [Cost & Usage Dashboard (Beta)](https://g-9d213fbc19.grafana-workspace.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/d/eefmlx7flj4sgc/finops?orgId=1)

Please note you will need to sign in with AWS IAM Identity Center. Access is based on your Observability Platform permissions.

## How to provide feedback

We want to improve our products based on your feedback and user needs. We have created a simple [feedback form](https://forms.office.com/e/a8fHd5MgQS) to capture feedback. You can submit as many feedback forms as you like.

## Additional notes

As this product is in a beta phase please be aware of the following constraints:

- dashboard may change based on user feedback or experiments we are conducting
- dashboard may be made unavialble without notice
