# AWS Cost & Usage Dashboard (Beta)

## Background

Making cost and usage data readily available is key to empowering informed, timely decision-making across the organisation. By providing visibility into cloud spend, usage patterns, and allocation, teams can better understand the financial impact of their technology choices. This transparency supports more accountable budgeting, encourages cost optimisation, and helps align cloud investment with business value. When FinOps data is accessible, it shifts cost conversations from reactive to strategic — turning insights into actions.

To support this we have created a dashboard to make data available.

This dashboard is in **beta phase** of development.

## How to access the dashboard

Access the dashboard via this link - [AWS Cost & Usage Dashboard (Beta)](https://dashboards.analytical-platform.service.justice.gov.uk/dashboards/d1b8e0de-a001-4f32-83d1-b37fd15e1a4f/).

You will be prompted to login with your **`@justice.gov.uk`** identity.
