# Assessment and Purchase of Savings Plans

## Purpose

The purpose of this guide is to formalise the process for assessment and purchase of Savings Plans. A [Savings Plan (SP)](https://aws.amazon.com/savingsplans/) is a cloud pricing model where users commit to using specific resources for a set term in exchange for discounted rates.

The guide provides a reusable framework to maximise effective use of SPs, and avoid vacancy (wasted commitments).

## Types of Savings Plan

There are 3 types of Savings Plan available:
- Compute
- EC2 Instance
- SageMaker AI

Our preferred type of plan is **Compute Saving Plan**, as it provides the greatest flexibility for how it applies saving,s and provides better coverage for the types of resources used by MoJ.

## Calculation of hourly usage

A key part of purchasing a Savings Plan is determining your hourly commitment. This is how much usuage you are committing to for a 1 year or 3 year period.

To determine our hourly usage we use the [Purchase Analyzer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/savingsplans/latest/userguide/sp-purchase-analysis.html) within the Billing and Cost Management console. When this process is finished it will provide you with an chart of hourly usage.

The peaks in the chart show spiky and inconsistent usage. Committing at these levels leads to waste. Ideally we want to choose an hourly rate that is below this spikly area i.e. the blue line. At MoJ we aim to cover **70%** of our usage. This ensures we maximise our savings without risk of over commitment. 

> NB - We may aim to increase this coverage as our practice matures.
