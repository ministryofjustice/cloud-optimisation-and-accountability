# Cloud Optimisation & Accountability Communications Plan

This plan details to the who, how and when we will communicate information to users and stakeholders.

## The Plan

The table below sets out the typical types of communications the Cloud Platform will want to issue.

There may be occasions where we want to publish something to the wider MoJ or the Public. In these instances we can publish something on the MoJ Justice Digital blog. Requests to publish on the blog should be made to #ask-comms in the first instance.
