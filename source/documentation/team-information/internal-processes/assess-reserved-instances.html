# Assessment and Purchase of Reserved Instances (RI)

## Purpose

The purpose of this guide is to formalise the process for assessment and purchase of RIs. A Reserved Instance is a cloud pricing model where users commit to using specific resources for a set term in exchange for discounted rates.

The guide provides a reusable framework to maximise effective use of RIs, and avoid vacancy (wasted commitments).

## Assessment of new RI opportunities

There are a number of steps to gather data and evaluate RIs to ensure that we are purchasing the best opportunities and minimise risk of waste.

### Gather recommendations

### Assessment against defined criteria

### Engagement

### Decision to purchase

## Review of existing RIs

On a monthly basis the performance of RIs is reviewed as part of the monthly COAT Check-In (meeting with Platforms & Architecture Leadership).

As part of the data gathering (Utilisation and Coverage metrics) we can see whether we can purchase more of an existing RI i.e. an existing instance type has increased so we could improve coverage by buying more units, or usage is reducing some hold off on buying more. We aim for **100% utilisation** and **85% coverage** of a reservation. This reduces risk of over reservation i.e. waste.

## Purchasing RIs

When the decision is made to purchase an RI there are some constraints around what we can purchase:
- Reservation for one year only
- No upfront cost (with the exception of DynamoDB which doesn't offer this and must be partical upfront cost).

Purchasing is carried out via the relevant AWS console or via CLI. Here is the relevant AS guidance for each RI type:

- [RDS Reserved Instances](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/reserved-instances/#2)
- [Opensearch Reserved Instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/latest/developerguide/ri.html)
- [Redshift Reserved Instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/purchase-reserved-node-offering-console.html)
- [Elasticache Reserved Instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonElastiCache/latest/dg/CacheNodes.Reserved.html#reserved-nodes-purchasing)
- [DynamoDB Reserved Capacity](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/reserved-capacity/)

## Logging RIs

To ensure we can track our RIs you must update the [AWS Reserved Instances Tracker](https://justiceuk.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/sites/CloudOptimisationAccoutabilityTeam/Shared%20Documents/Internal%20Team/Reserved%20Instances/AWS%20Reserved%20Instances%20Tracker%20FY%202025-26.xlsx?d=w1e2d842764444edc8a7d4d2eceea528f&csf=1&web=1&e=P0Awt8) for the relevant financial year.
