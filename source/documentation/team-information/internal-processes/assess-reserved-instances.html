# Assessment and Purchase of Reserved Instances (RI)

## Purpose

The purpose of this guide is to formalise the process for assessment and purchase of RIs. It provides a reusable framework to maximise effective use of RIs, and avoid vacancy (wasted commitments).

## Assessment of new RI opportunities

## Review of existing RIs

## Purchasing RIs

When the decision is made to purchase an RI there are some constraints around what we can purchase:
- Reservation for one year only
- No upfront cost (with the exception of DynamoDB which doesn't offer this and must be partical upfront cost).

Purchasing is carried out via the relevant AWS console or via CLI. Here is the relevant AS guidance for each RI type:

- [RDS Reserved Instances](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/reserved-instances/#2)
- [Opensearch Reserved Instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/latest/developerguide/ri.html)
- [Redshift Reserved Instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/purchase-reserved-node-offering-console.html)
- [Elasticache Reserved Instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonElastiCache/latest/dg/CacheNodes.Reserved.html#reserved-nodes-purchasing)
- [DynamoDB Reserved Capacity](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/reserved-capacity/)

##Â Logging RIs

To ensure we can track our RIs you must update the [AWS Reserved Instances Tracker](https://justiceuk.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/sites/CloudOptimisationAccoutabilityTeam/Shared%20Documents/Internal%20Team/Reserved%20Instances/AWS%20Reserved%20Instances%20Tracker%20FY%202025-26.xlsx?d=w1e2d842764444edc8a7d4d2eceea528f&csf=1&web=1&e=P0Awt8) for the relevant financial year.
