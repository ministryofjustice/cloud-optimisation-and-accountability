# Refreshing SPICE Datasets in QuickSight

Our SPICE datasets are set to refresh daily at 6am on a schedule.

During development, If a change has been made to the structure of a derived table, 
or new data has been added to the table, you must manually refresh the SPICE dataset to pull the latest data changes
into QuickSight, if you want to use it in your analysis:

1) Navigate to the "Datasets" section in the QuickSight area of the Control Panel and 
select the relevant SPICE dataset that has been modified

![select spice dataset](../../images/select-spice-dataset.png)

3) Navigate to the "Refresh" tab of the dataset and click on "Refresh Now"

4) Select "Full refresh" and click "Continue". Click "Refresh".

![confirm spice refresh](../../images/confirm-spice-refresh.png)

The latest version of the data will be pulled into the QuickSight SPICE memory cache from the Athena data source
in AP Compute. You will now be able to use the latest data from the analysis.
